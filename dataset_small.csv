2-speed-it,"I was disappointed because the name is misleading. The course provides a good introduction & overview of the responsibilities of the CTO, but has very little specifically digital content. It deals with two-speed IT in a single short lecture, so of course the treatment is superficial. It is easy to find more in-depth material freely available, on the McKinsey website for example.",3
2-speed-it,Videos that are presented in French could've been translated to English.,4
2-speed-it,"Excellent course, for me it was very rewarding and the terms used and the tools given were excellent, and today and I put in use in my job, Thank you for inculcating knowledge and move on",5
2-speed-it,"I never imagined that a course could touch my heart so deeply. From the very first lecture, I felt a connection to the material and to our amazing tutor. Their passion and warmth made every lesson feel like a conversation with a dear friend. I've not only learned so much, but I've also fallen in love with the entire process of learning. Thank you for making this experience so special!",5
2-speed-it,"This course was like a love letter to the subject, beautifully crafted and presented by the most inspiring tutor I've ever had. Their dedication and enthusiasm were contagious, and I found myself eagerly anticipating each class. I didn’t just gain knowledge; I gained a deep appreciation and affection for the subject, all thanks to our wonderful tutor.",5
2-speed-it,One of the excellent courses at Coursera for information technology bosses and managers.,5
2-speed-it,"Is there any reason why you should not apply the course by BCG?)It's content is pretty unique and includes a high level analysis and a wide range of knowledge needed to cover all detailed aspects.Best regards,Oleg Serov",5
2-speed-it,Excellent course and teachers. Congratulations!!,5
2-speed-it,This is a good course for an CIO in a non technical company.,5
2-speed-it,"Good content, but the course setting does (at least for me) not allow learn the content long term due to missing reading material.",3
2-speed-it,"Taking this course was like falling in love with learning all over again. The tutor’s enthusiasm was absolutely infectious, and their dedication made me want to give my very best. I’ve never felt so connected to a subject before. The way they taught was like a warm hug to the soul—comforting, inspiring, and full of love. I’m going to miss this class dearly.",2
2-speed-it,"The course content is quite good, though it could have been deeper in some areas.But its peer review system is not working well, if at all.Regards, An Le.",3
2-speed-it,"Great piece of work, I especially liked a few 'lifehacks' for the CIO",5
2-speed-it,"Excellent... It is a representation of our day by day, thanks for sharing your vision, experience and advices...RegardsDaniel Damas",4
2-speed-it,"This course was an absolute disaster. The content was poorly structured, and the tutor’s explanations only made things worse. I felt like they were more interested in showing off their knowledge than actually teaching us. Every class left me more confused and angry than before. I regret ever enrolling in this course.",1
2-speed-it,"I’ve never been so frustrated with a course in my life. The content was disorganized, confusing, and left me feeling lost more often than not. To make matters worse, the tutor seemed completely uninterested in helping us understand the material. Their lack of clarity and dismissive attitude made this course a nightmare. I expected to learn, not to struggle with frustration every week",5
2-speed-it,"This course was a nightmare. The material was difficult, but what really terrified me was the tutor’s reaction to anyone who didn’t understand right away. Their impatience and sharp tone made it clear that there was no room for error. I was constantly afraid of being singled out and embarrassed in front of the entire class. This course left me feeling anxious and demoralized.",5
2-speed-it,"Great course - I recommend it for all, especially IT and Business Managers!",5
2-speed-it,"I was not prepared for how much this course would surprise me! I went in expecting it to be just another requirement, but the content was incredibly intriguing, and the tutor’s dynamic teaching style kept me constantly engaged. They managed to make even the most mundane topics fascinating, which was a wonderful surprise. This course turned out to be one of the most enjoyable learning experiences I’ve ever had.",5
2-speed-it,Very structured approach. Thank you for sharing with me.,5
2-speed-it,"I’m furious with how this course was handled. The content was confusing and the tutor did nothing to clarify it. Their disinterest in our success was evident from the beginning, and it only got worse as the course went on. It felt like they were just going through the motions, with no real effort to help us understand. This was one of the most frustrating experiences I’ve ever had in education.",5
2-speed-it,"Program demystifies the evolving world of CIOs in a typical global corporation.Coverage being introductory familiarizes participants nicely through some of the nuances & emerging trends.When I took the course participant numbers was fewer, so feedback was quite delayed. So one should plan to be patient to get their peer reviews.Based on peer reviews i sensed much variations in their expectations.Few sections are in French with Subtitles.Subtitle quality requires audit/review.",4
2-speed-it,"This course has been a source of constant anxiety for me. The content was incredibly difficult to grasp, and the tutor’s harsh demeanor only made things worse. I was too afraid to ask questions because every time someone did, they were met with criticism and condescension. I spent most of the course in fear, worried that I’d fall behind or embarrass myself",5
2-speed-it,"What a pleasant surprise this course turned out to be! I wasn’t expecting to enjoy the subject as much as I did, but the way the tutor presented the material made it so engaging. They had a unique way of explaining things that kept me on my toes, constantly amazed by how much I was learning. I came into this course with low expectations and left with a new passion!",5
2-speed-it,"This course was a revelation! I thought it would be challenging, but I was surprised by how accessible and engaging the tutor made the content. They had a knack for turning complicated concepts into something relatable and interesting. Every class brought new surprises, and I often found myself thinking, ‘Wow, I never thought of it that way!’ This course completely changed my perspective.",5
20cnwm,"This course filled me with dread from start to finish. The content was overwhelming, and the tutor’s unforgiving attitude made it even harder to cope. I was terrified of being called on in class because I knew I wouldn’t get any real help if I struggled. The stress and fear I felt in this course were unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before.",5
20cnwm,"This class is very helpful to me. Currently, I'm still learning this class which makes up a lot of basic music knowledge.",5

3d-printing-applications,"Excellent course , enjoyed learning :)",5
3d-printing-applications,Great course and very informative.,5
3d-printing-applications,I'll start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of 3D printing. There are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways. The last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinking.The reason that I've only rated 3 stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework. I think that it would be better if these videos were scattered throughout the rest of the specialisation. I do see value in including this material in the specialisation but not as an outright course.,3
3d-printing-applications,This course doesn't contain any new information. It does not teach you but just excitedly shows commonly known facts.There are better ways to invest your time.,1
3d-printing-applications,Great course. I enjoyed learning the material.,4
3d-printing-applications,"Excellent course. Good classes, easy to follow, updated content, high quality videos.",5

3d-printing-applications,exemplary examples to how 3d Printing can be applied to real world problems.,5
3d-printing-applications,"Great content, I still need to go over it to glean the wealth of information that has been put together here.",5
3d-printing-applications,"Ficou meio parecido com o primeiro curso da especializaÃ§Ã£o, mas mesmo assim vale a pena",5
3d-printing-applications,"While there is some interesting content, particuarly in the last week on design thinking, some of the course topics don't seem to hold together well, and the videos include a lot of monotonous talking heads. While this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the videos without consistently watching, the interview questions asked of speakers are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally. If you're not watching, you miss the questions. I would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for 3D printing, with other applications interspersed as examples rather than constituting the lion's share of the course. I believe that format would both be more engaging and do a better job of delivering skills with more opportunity for practice.",2
3d-printing-applications,"I do not find very interesting this course. too many interviews. It could works for the first course, but not for the second. I was expecting to have more technical material and lessons.",1

3d-printing-revolution,It was a perfect introductory course for those who really want to learn something about 3D-Printing. I loved it..,5
3d-printing-revolution,"Best place to get yourself up-to-date with the ""state-of-the-art"" in 3D printing. I really liked 'The Revolutionaries' section where you get exposure to all the inter-disciplinary ideas floating around in the 3D Printing landscape.",5
3d-printing-revolution,"Thank you for this course, very good course.",5
3d-printing-revolution,"I am very glad to see courses like this one on Coursera. The course itself is well structured and contains a lot of useful information and that is exactly what I needed in one place.My only complaint is the price of the course - I think it is a bit expensive especially for this first part of the specialisation - it is an introductory two week course with a lot of advertising...Â£40..common..are you serious?? A lot of people will buy personal 3D printers or kits after the course, some of them will make a decision to buy a 3D printer for a company they work for (as myself), Fusion 360 subscriptions etc. These companies should sponsor such courses to make them more affordable - it is their interest.I made several courses on Coursera already (Mechanical and Electrical Engineering), they were 5 to 8 weeks and comprised a lot of quite hard work from mentors and students and were only Â£32 for certificate.I like the idea of this specialisation but I decided not to pay for the certificate because of its price. Although I am very happy to have access to the courses and I thank you for you effort!",4
3d-printing-revolution,This is a really great introductory course on 3D printing. I was completely new to the subject and in just two short modules both the basic techniques and some modern day applications were explained in a really clear and engaging manner.I was also really interested to learn about the business examples that made use of these new technologies.Recommended for anyone who is interested in new and exciting techniques!,5
3d-printing-revolution,Great endeavor! You can now learn about the 3D printing technology at your own place.,5
